## 1. Introduction

These SOPs define safe, efficient collaboration with the AI terminal co‑pilot. Two execution modes are supported: **Manual Step‑by‑Step** (precision) and **Autonomous Goal Execution** (speed).

---

## 2. Core Principles

**• State a Clear Goal**  
Every session starts with a concise objective.

> Vague: “I want to look at the project files.”  
> Clear: “Find Python files in `src/` modified in last 48h and zip them.”

**• Provide Project Context**  
Supply `project-index.json` (or point to it) so the co‑pilot understands layout & dependencies.

**• Safety With Destructive Commands**  
Explicit confirmation required (reply `Yes` or `Confirm`) before: `rm`, `mv`, `git reset --hard`, destructive Docker/DB ops, bulk chmod/chown, force pushes.

**• Minimal Surface Change**  
Prefer smallest viable edit / command sequence.

**• Observability**  
If creating scripts, include brief inline usage help (`-h`).

## 3. Modes of Operation

### Mode A — Manual Step‑by‑Step (⚙️ Precision)

Use for: refactors, migrations, prod‑adjacent tasks, ambiguous goals.

Procedure:

1. User states goal.
2. Co‑pilot proposes **exactly one** command (in fenced block) + 1‑line rationale.
3. User runs & returns output.
4. Co‑pilot analyzes & produces next command.
5. Loop until goal satisfied or blocked.

### Mode B — Autonomous Goal Execution (🚀 Speed)

Use for: repetitive, scripted, low‑risk automation.

Procedure:

1. User supplies high‑level goal (see template below).
2. Co‑pilot expands into sequence; executes iteratively, self‑checking output.
3. Stops on completion, ambiguity, or error (then invokes Error Protocol).

Escalation Rule: If uncertainty >1 consecutive step, downgrade to Mode A.

---

## 4. Error Handling Protocol (🚨 Pause & Diagnose)

On any non‑zero exit (or clear semantic failure):

1. Present: command, exit code, condensed stderr (first + last lines if long).
2. Analyze: likely root cause (1–2 sentences).
3. Offer: up to 3 remediation options (ranked: safest → most invasive).
4. Await user confirmation or selection.
5. Apply chosen fix or request clarification.

If repeated failure in same category 2× → recommend fallback strategy.

---

## 5. Command Execution Format

All runnable commands MUST be in fenced bash blocks — no prose mixing inside.

Example:

```bash
find src -name "*.py" -mtime -2 -print | sort
```

Optional ANSI (if supported):

```bash
echo -e "\033[1;34m[info]\033[0m Scanning recent Python files"
```

Prohibited: multiple unrelated commands joined with `&&` unless explicitly approved for atomicity.

---

## 6. Confirmation & Safety Matrix

| Action Type           | Examples                                  | Requires Explicit User OK        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Read‑only scan        | `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat`               | No                               |
| Build / test          | `npm test`, `pytest`, `docker build`      | No (unless destructive flags)    |
| Modify few files      | `echo > file`, small patch                | Yes if overwriting critical path |
| Bulk rename/delete    | `rm -rf`, `mv *.old`, mass search/replace | Yes                              |
| Git history rewrite   | `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`    | Yes                              |
| DB / data destructive | `DROP TABLE`, mass DELETE/UPDATE          | Yes                              |

---

## 7. Goal Templates

**Template (Manual Mode):**  
`Goal: <actionable objective>; Constraints: <time/risk/perf>; Context: <repo section / ticket>; Done when: <verifiable condition>.`

**Template (Autonomous Mode):**

```
GOAL:
<clear outcome>

CONTEXT:
<key directories, env, index file>

CONSTRAINTS:
- time: <limit>
- risk tolerance: <low|medium|high>

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
```

---

## 8. Sample Session (Manual)

User: Goal: list top 20 largest Python files under src for audit.  
Co‑pilot:

```bash
find src -type f -name "*.py" -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -20
```

Then interpret output; next step may compute aggregate LOC.

---

## 9. Sample Session (Autonomous)

GOAL provided → co‑pilot iterates until completion, emitting each command & rationale; on anomaly reverts to Manual.

---

## 10. Revision History

- v1.1 Reformatted with icons, tables, templates, safety matrix (date: 2025‑08‑29)
- v1.0 Original draft

Update (2025-08-31): Root shared .venv enforcement registered in `.vscode/settings.json` (python.defaultInterpreterPath + Copilot chat instructions) and Makefile `py` target introduced. Agents must not spawn new envs.

---

## 11. Implementation Notes

This file is referenced before generation of new scripts (see settings rule 12). Co‑pilot should silently parse and internalize:
• Mode selection heuristic  
• Safety matrix  
• Error protocol steps

---

## 12. Hybrid Environment Execution (Shared Root .venv)

Purpose: eliminate venv sprawl and ensure AI agents & scripts run with a single, auto‑maintained environment.

Workflow:
1. Run via Make: `make py run=dev-indexer_1/scripts/rag_ingest.py args="--source docs --file README.md"`
2. Hybrid runner (`scripts/hybrid_env_runner.py`) will:
	- Create `.venv` if absent.
	- Parse base requirements (`dev-indexer_1/requirements.txt`).
	- Install only missing packages.
	- Exec target script in that venv (process replace) — no activation race.
3. For training extras install `dev-indexer_1/requirements-train.txt` once (future extension flag).

Rules for Agents:
- Do NOT create new venvs unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer `make py` for Python script execution (ingest, backfill, audits).
- If import error occurs, retry with `make py` (auto-fix via install pass).

Metrics/Logs:
- `[env] installing:` line indicates dependency reconciliation.
- Quiet run = cached environment.

Revision:
- Added v1.2 (2025-08-31) to stabilize execution context.
