This is a regular document with no tabular structure.

It contains multiple paragraphs of normal text that should not be 
detected as tables by the OCR processing system.

Here's another paragraph with some numbers like 123 and 456, but 
they're not arranged in any tabular format.

The purpose of this file is to test that the system gracefully 
handles text without tables and doesn't create false positives.

Some more text here to make it realistic.
- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two  
- Bullet point three

End of document.
