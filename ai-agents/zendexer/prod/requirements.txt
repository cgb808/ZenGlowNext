# --- Cloud Security/Firewall Requirements ---
# 1. Use cloud provider firewall/security groups to restrict inbound ports (e.g., 8004) to trusted IPs or internal networks only.
# 2. Deploy all services in a private subnet/VPC; expose only necessary endpoints via a secure reverse proxy or API gateway.
# 3. Use encrypted Docker overlay networks for inter-service communication.
# 4. Place a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) in front of public endpoints, enforce TLS, authentication, and IP allowlists.
# 5. Never expose secrets or sensitive ports to the public; use Docker secrets or cloud KMS.
# 6. Monitor firewall logs and set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
# 7. Document and review all firewall/networking rules as part of SOC 2 compliance.
