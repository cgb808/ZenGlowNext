## Overview

This document updates the ZenGlow threat model to include the new encrypted sensor data storage implementation, addressing at-rest data protection for buffered sensor readings.

## New Assets Protected

### Sensitive Sensor Data

- **Stress Level Indicators**: Mental health data with privacy implications
- **Breathing Rate**: Respiratory health metrics
- **Sleep Quality**: Personal health patterns
- **Mood Indicators**: Emotional state data
- **Engagement Levels**: Behavioral tracking data

### Encryption Keys
- **Per-Install Master Keys**: Device-specific encryption keys stored in keychain
- **Key Rotation History**: Previous keys maintained for data migration
- **Key Metadata**: Creation timestamps, expiration dates, and version information

## Threat Analysis

### 1. Local Storage Data Exfiltration âœ… MITIGATED

**Threat**: Malicious apps or physical device access reading plaintext sensor data from local storage.

**Previous Risk**: HIGH - Sensor data stored in plaintext in AsyncStorage
**Current Risk**: LOW - Sensitive fields encrypted with AES-256

**Mitigation Implemented**:
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields (value, quality)
- Per-install encryption keys stored in hardware-backed keychain
- Non-sensitive metadata remains unencrypted for performance

**Attack Scenarios Blocked**:
- Root access reading app storage directory
- Backup file analysis revealing health data
- Malware scanning for health metrics
- Forensic analysis of device storage

### 2. Key Compromise and Recovery âœ… MITIGATED

**Threat**: Encryption keys compromised requiring system recovery.

**Previous Risk**: N/A - No encryption in place
**Current Risk**: MEDIUM - Mitigated with rotation capability

**Mitigation Implemented**:
- Key rotation capability with automatic re-encryption
- Hardware-backed keychain storage (iOS Secure Enclave, Android Keystore)
- Key expiration and versioning system
- Emergency key invalidation procedures

**Recovery Procedures**:
- Automatic key rotation every 30 days
- Manual key rotation on security events
- Re-encryption of all stored data with new keys
- Old key invalidation and cleanup

### 3. Data Migration Vulnerabilities âœ… MITIGATED

**Threat**: Data exposure during migration from plaintext to encrypted storage.

**Previous Risk**: HIGH - No migration strategy
**Current Risk**: LOW - Secure migration with integrity checks

**Mitigation Implemented**:
- Atomic migration operations with rollback capability
- Migration status tracking and resumption
- Data integrity verification during migration
- Secure deletion of plaintext data after encryption

**Migration Security Features**:
- Incremental migration to avoid performance impact
- Error handling and partial migration recovery
- Progress tracking and audit logging
- Verification of encrypted data integrity

### 4. Buffer Management Attack Vectors âœ… MITIGATED

**Threat**: Buffer overflow, manipulation, or unauthorized access to sensor data buffers.

**Previous Risk**: MEDIUM - Basic buffer management
**Current Risk**: LOW - Secure buffer with size limits and encryption

**Mitigation Implemented**:
- Buffer size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Encrypted storage of buffered sensor readings
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- Buffer integrity validation

**Security Controls**:
- Maximum buffer size enforcement (1000 readings)
- Retention period enforcement by sensor type
- Buffer corruption detection and recovery
- Secure buffer initialization and cleanup

### 5. Cross-Child Data Leakage âœ… MITIGATED

**Threat**: Sensor data from one child accessible by another child profile.

**Previous Risk**: MEDIUM - Shared storage without isolation
**Current Risk**: LOW - Child-specific encryption and isolation

**Mitigation Implemented**:
- Child-specific sensor buffers with unique identifiers
- Separate encryption contexts per child
- Access control validation for data retrieval
- Audit logging of cross-child access attempts

**Isolation Guarantees**:
- Child ID embedded in storage keys
- No shared sensor data structures
- Independent buffer management per child
- Child-specific key derivation (future enhancement)

## Data Classification Updates

### Highly Sensitive (AES-256 Encrypted)
- Heart rate values and quality indicators
- Stress level measurements and quality indicators
- Breathing rate measurements
- Sleep quality assessments
- Mood indicator values

### Moderately Sensitive (Unencrypted Metadata)
- Timestamps for performance optimization
- Sensor types for filtering
- Device metadata for diagnostics
- Buffer management information

### Non-Sensitive (Plaintext)
- Reading IDs for database operations
- Encryption flags for migration status
- Statistical aggregations for analytics

## Compliance Impact

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- âœ… Enhanced protection for children's health data
- âœ… Parental data access controls maintained
- âœ… Data minimization through retention policies
- âœ… Secure deletion of expired sensitive data

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- âœ… At-rest encryption for health information
- âœ… Access controls and audit logging
- âœ… Data integrity and availability protections
- âœ… Secure transmission to healthcare providers (existing)

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- âœ… Right to be forgotten with secure deletion
- âœ… Data portability with encrypted exports
- âœ… Privacy by design with selective encryption
- âœ… Data breach notification with impact assessment

## Operational Security Changes

### Key Management Operations
- **Daily**: Automated health checks of encryption keys
- **Weekly**: Key rotation eligibility assessment
- **Monthly**: Forced key rotation and re-encryption
- **Emergency**: Immediate key invalidation and rotation

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Key Access**: Monitor keychain access patterns
- **Migration Status**: Track plaintext to encrypted migration
- **Buffer Health**: Monitor buffer sizes and cleanup operations
- **Decryption Failures**: Alert on potential key compromise

### Incident Response Updates
- **Key Compromise**: Immediate rotation and re-encryption procedures
