# ZenGlow Audio Guide

This app supports cloud-delivered audio via Supabase Edge Functions with local caching, plus optional tiny local UI sounds bundled for instant feedback.

## Architecture

- Cloud manifest: A Supabase Edge Function (e.g., `/functions/v1/match-audio-clips`) returns a JSON manifest mapping sound names to CDN/signed URLs.
- Local cache: `expo-file-system` caches downloads (utils/audio/RemoteAudioCache.ts).
- Provider: `components/Audio/ZenSoundProvider.tsx` resolves sources from:
  1.  optional local bundle (components/Audio/localSoundMap.ts)
  2.  remote manifest override (set at runtime)
  3.  default entries (volume/loop only)
- Prewarm: Screens can prefetch and preload sounds for a view to avoid first-tap latency.

## Usage

1. Fetch manifest from Supabase edge:

   - Use `fetchSoundManifest({ supabaseUrl, anonKey, view })` from `utils/audio/SupabaseAudio.ts`.

2. Apply manifest and prewarm:

   - From within a screen or layout: `const { setRemoteManifest, prewarmSounds } = useZenSound();`
   - `setRemoteManifest(manifest)` and then `await prewarmSounds(['zen_click_soft','zen_chime']);`

3. Play:
   - `const { playUI, playLoop, stopLoop, playAmbient, stopAmbient } = useZenSound();`

## Optional tiny local sounds

- Put tiny assets (e.g., <20KB UI taps) in `assets/sounds/ui/`.
- Map them in `components/Audio/localSoundMap.ts`, for example:

  // components/Audio/localSoundMap.ts
  export default {
  zen_click_soft: require('../../assets/sounds/ui/zen_click_soft.mp3'),
  zen_chime: require('../../assets/sounds/ui/zen_chime.mp3'),
  };

- These take precedence over remote URLs for minimal latency.

## Warm pulls per view

- Use `hooks/useWarmSounds.ts` in a screen:
  - `useWarmSounds(['zen_click_soft', 'zen_chime']);`
  - Optionally call `setRemoteManifest` first after fetching from Supabase.

## Dependencies

- expo-av, expo-file-system
- Metro already supports mp3/wav/aac/m4a assets via `metro.config.js`.

## Notes

- Never include large music/lullaby files locally; stream/cache via CDN.
- Signed URLs should be short-lived and refreshed as needed by the edge function.
