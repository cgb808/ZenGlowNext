# ZenGlow Workspace Audit: Incomplete & Unfinished Work

## Critical Incomplete Features & Stubs

### 1. ZenMoonAvatar (src/components/ZenMoon/ZenMoonAvatar.tsx)

- `useZenMoon` is a **mock implementation**. The real hook is missing.
  - **TODO:** Implement `useZenMoon` in `src/hooks/useZenMoon.ts` and import it.
- Comments and TODOs in the file mark this as a stub for future work.

### 2. ParentDashboard (src/components/parent/ParentDashboard.tsx)

- **Dashboard views** (`DailyView`, `WeeklyView`, `TrendsView`) are **placeholders only**.
  - **TODO:** Implement these as real components and replace the placeholder text.

### 3. General

- No other major stubs or incomplete hooks found in the main dashboard or sound hooks.
- Some comments in handler hooks indicate where real app logic (analytics, audio, etc.) would go, but all core logic is present.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Implement `useZenMoon` hook in `src/hooks/useZenMoon.ts`.
- [ ] Replace mock in `ZenMoonAvatar.tsx` with real hook import.
- [ ] Implement `DailyView`, `WeeklyView`, and `TrendsView` components for the dashboard.
- [ ] Replace placeholder text in `ParentDashboard.tsx` with real components.

**Note:**

- All other hooks and handlers are implemented with error handling and mock data where needed.
- No major API or feature stubs found outside the above.
