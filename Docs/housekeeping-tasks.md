# Housekeeping: Irrelevant/Unused Files & Directory Structure

This document tracks files and folders that are candidates for deletion, as well as missing directories that should be created to match the intended project structure.

---

## Candidates for Deletion

### 1. Orphaned/Redundant Sidecar Files

- Many files like `types/parentChildTypes.ts.sidecar.yaml.sidecar.yaml.sidecar.yaml...` and `utils/SmartSoundManager.ts.sidecar.yaml.sidecar.yaml...` are the result of recursive or buggy sidecar generation. **Mark for deletion.**

### 2. IDE/Tooling Artifacts

- `.idea/` (JetBrains IDE project files) — not needed for VS Code projects. **Mark for deletion or add to `.gitignore`.**
- `.expo/` — auto-generated by Expo, should not be committed. **Already in `.gitignore`.**

### 3. Out-of-Structure or Legacy Files

- Any files not present in the canonical structure (see below) or not referenced in code/docs.

---

## Canonical Project Structure (from `file structure zenglow`)

- `audio-drop/`
- `components/`
- `configs/`
- `Docs/`
- `hooks/`
- `schemas/`
- `scripts/`
- `src/`
- `supabase/`
- `types/`
- `utils/`
- Root config files: `App.js`, `app.json`, `cspell.json`, `ktlint`, `metro.config.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `ZenGlow.code-workspace`

---

## Action Items

- Delete or archive all `.sidecar.yaml.sidecar.yaml...` files.
- Remove `.idea/` if not using JetBrains IDEs.
- Ensure all canonical folders exist; create any that are missing.
- Move or refactor files that are not in the canonical structure.
