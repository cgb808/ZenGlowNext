# Keyword / pattern triggers for voice routing heuristic boosts.
# Simple initial list; future: weights & regex support.
# Format:
# categories:
#   analysis: ["analyze", "compare", "explain", "why", "reason about"]
#   math: ["integral", "derivative", "matrix", "solve", "equation"]
#   code: ["function", "class", "import", "bug", "refactor"]
#   health: ["heart rate", "sleep", "stress", "recovery", "fatigue"]
#   tutoring: ["teach", "help me understand", "practice", "quiz me"]
#   memory: ["remember this", "store this", "log this"]
#   planning: ["plan", "schedule", "roadmap", "milestone"]
#   mood_support: ["feeling", "anxious", "overwhelmed", "encourage"]
#
# Implementation note: initial router only loads file optionally for manual inspection;
# actual boost integration to be added with intent classifier phase.
