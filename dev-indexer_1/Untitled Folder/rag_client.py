"""RAG Client Stub

HistoricalRagClient provides retrieval of prior failure/recovery narratives
from a (future) vector store such as Supabase pgvector. For now this is a
lightweight in-memory / placeholder implementation so the scheduler and
predictive hook can be wired without external dependencies.

Future implementation outline:
 - Initialize with Supabase URL + service key.
 - Embed query describing current partition state (low success_ema etc.).
 - Perform similarity search against a 'swarm_failures' table storing
   (partition_id, window_stats, narrative, embedding).
 - Return a concise textual summary for decision context.
