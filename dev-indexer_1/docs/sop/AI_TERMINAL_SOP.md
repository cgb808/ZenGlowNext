1. Introduction
These SOPs define safe, efficient collaboration with the AI terminal co‑pilot. Two execution modes are supported: Manual Step‑by‑Step (precision) and Autonomous Goal Execution (speed).

2. Core Principles
• State a Clear Goal
Every session starts with a concise objective.

Vague: “I want to look at the project files.”
Clear: “Find Python files in src/ modified in last 48h and zip them.”

• Provide Project Context
Supply project-index.json (or point to it) so the co‑pilot understands layout & dependencies.

• Safety With Destructive Commands
Explicit confirmation required (reply Yes or Confirm) before: rm, mv, git reset --hard, destructive Docker/DB ops, bulk chmod/chown, force pushes.

• Minimal Surface Change
Prefer smallest viable edit / command sequence.

• Observability
If creating scripts, include brief inline usage help (-h).

3. Modes of Operation
Mode A — Manual Step‑by‑Step (⚙️ Precision)
Use for: refactors, migrations, prod‑adjacent tasks, ambiguous goals. Procedure:

User states goal.
Co‑pilot proposes exactly one command (fenced) + 1‑line rationale.
User runs & returns output.
Co‑pilot analyzes & produces next command.
Loop until goal satisfied or blocked.
Mode B — Autonomous Goal Execution (🚀 Speed)
Use for: repetitive, scripted, low‑risk automation. Procedure:

User supplies high‑level goal (see template below).
Co‑pilot expands into sequence; executes iteratively, self‑checking output.
Stops on completion, ambiguity, or error (then invokes Error Protocol).
Escalation Rule: If uncertainty >1 consecutive step, downgrade to Mode A.

4. Error Handling Protocol (🚨 Pause & Diagnose)
On any non‑zero exit (or semantic failure):

Present: command, exit code, condensed stderr (first & last lines if long).
Analyze: likely root cause (1–2 sentences).
Offer: up to 3 remediation options (safest → most invasive).
Await user confirmation or selection.
Apply chosen fix or request clarification. If repeated failure in same category 2× → recommend fallback strategy.
5. Command Execution Format
All runnable commands MUST be in fenced bash blocks.

find src -name "*.py" -mtime -2 -print | sort
Optional ANSI:

echo -e "\033[1;34m[info]\033[0m Scanning recent Python files"
Prohibited: multiple unrelated commands chained with && unless approved for atomicity.

6. Confirmation & Safety Matrix
Action Type	Examples	Requires Explicit User OK
Read‑only scan	ls, find, grep, cat	No
Build / test	npm test, pytest, docker build	No (unless destructive)
Modify few files	echo > file, small patch	Yes if critical overwrite
Bulk rename/delete	rm -rf, mv *.old, mass search/replace	Yes
Git history rewrite	git reset --hard, git push --force	Yes
DB / data destructive	DROP TABLE, mass DELETE/UPDATE	Yes
7. Goal Templates
Manual Mode: Goal: <actionable objective>; Constraints: <time/risk/perf>; Context: <repo section / ticket>; Done when: <verifiable condition>.

Autonomous Mode:

GOAL:
<clear outcome>

CONTEXT:
<key directories, env, index file>

CONSTRAINTS:
- time: <limit>
- risk tolerance: <low|medium|high>

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
8. Sample Session (Manual)
User: Goal: list top 20 largest Python files under src for audit.
Co‑pilot:

find src -type f -name "*.py" -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -20
9. Sample Session (Autonomous)
GOAL provided → co‑pilot iterates until completion; on anomaly reverts to Manual.
