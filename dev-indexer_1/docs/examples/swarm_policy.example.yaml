# Example: Swarm-style agent routing policy (illustrative)
# NOTE: This is NOT consumed by Docker Swarm directly. It documents a logical
# routing policy you might implement in an app-level scheduler/router.
# Wire-up ideas: a control-plane service could parse this to decide
# how to allocate tasks to different worker groups.
