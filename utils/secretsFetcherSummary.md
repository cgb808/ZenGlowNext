# Secrets Fetcher Configuration Summary

## Objective
The goal was to configure and test the `secretFetcher.ts` file to securely initialize the Supabase client and handle CORS dynamically.

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Initial Setup
- Reviewed the existing `secretFetcher.ts` file.
- Identified that the file initializes a Supabase client with placeholder values for the URL and key.

### 2. CORS Integration
- Updated the `secretFetcher.ts` file to include dynamic CORS handling using the `getCorsHeaders` function from `corsHandler.js`.
- Ensured that the CORS headers are dynamically set based on the request's origin.

### 3. Testing Challenges
- Attempted to test the updated `secretFetcher.ts` file using `ts-node`.
- Encountered errors due to the `.ts` file being treated as an ES module.

### 4. TypeScript Runtime Setup
- Installed `ts-node` to enable running TypeScript files directly.
- Configured the `tsconfig.json` file to support ES modules.

### 5. Testing Attempts
- Ran the `secretFetcher.ts` file with `ts-node` and the `--esm` flag.
- Encountered persistent errors related to the `.ts` file extension.

### 6. Next Steps
- Suggested compiling the TypeScript file to JavaScript using `tsc` and running the compiled file with Node.js.

---

## Current Status
- The `secretFetcher.ts` file has been updated with dynamic CORS handling.
- Testing is pending due to runtime configuration issues.

---

## Recommendations
1. Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript using `tsc`.
2. Run the compiled JavaScript file with Node.js to verify functionality.
3. Ensure the `tsconfig.json` file is correctly configured for ES modules.
